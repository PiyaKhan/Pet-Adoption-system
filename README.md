Pet Adoption and Management System: 

      o Create a platform for pet adoption agencies or shelters to list animals available for adoption. 
      o Implement features such as animal profiles, adoption applications, adoption status tracking, and donation processing. 
      o Use PHP for backend adoption management, MySQL for storing animal and adoption data, and JavaScript for interactive adoption listings and application forms.
